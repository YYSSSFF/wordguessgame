# Word Guessing Game

## Description

A simple Python-based word guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen word from a predefined list. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and keeps track of the number of attempts left.

## Features

- Welcomes the player and personalizes the experience by asking for their name.
- Chooses a random word from a list of programming-related terms.
- Allows the player to guess letters in the word, providing feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Tracks the number of attempts and informs the player of their progress.
- Ends the game when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
